# Lilo Senior Companion — **Business View for Healthcare **
*Date: 2025-08-19*

## 1) Executive summary (why this matters to Healthcare)
- **Coverage multiplier for care management:** Lilo provides friendly, **emotion‑aware** check‑ins between human touches and routes real risk sooner—without adding headcount. fileciteturn3file0
- **Experience + outcomes:** Conversations convert into **micro‑interventions** (breathing, journaling, call‑a‑friend, reminders) and **auditable safety** events, supporting CAHPS narratives and quality ops. fileciteturn3file2
- **Software‑first rollout:** Works on existing devices (web/mobile; optional voice), **HIPAA‑ready** with consented memory and right‑to‑erasure; pilot‑ready in weeks. fileciteturn3file1
- **Pilot‑first de‑risking:** We prove value with **leading indicators** (engagement ≥25 min/week, emotion regulation deltas, UCLA‑3 shift) and directional utilization signals before scale. fileciteturn3file0

---

## 2) Healthcare‑aligned value drivers
- **Member Experience (CAHPS/HOS):** Warm, proactive interactions drive “felt support”; we report engagement, mood deltas, nudges, and escalations. fileciteturn3file2
- **Care‑manager leverage:** Earlier surfacing of rising‑risk and templated handoffs keep human clinicians focused on cases that truly need them. fileciteturn3file0
- **Affordability:** Directional reduction in avoidable ED/IP among engaged cohorts; we model scenarios, not promises, in early phases. fileciteturn3file1
- **Auditability & governance:** Deterministic safety playbooks; logged rationale; DSAR/erasure. fileciteturn3file0

**Primary use cases for Healthcare:**
1) **Loneliness/SDoH cohorts** (HOS, Z‑codes) → systematic engagement + reporting. fileciteturn3file1  
2) **Post‑discharge reassurance** → daily check‑ins, med nudges, warm handoffs. fileciteturn3file2  
3) **BH waitlist** → safe, empathic companionship until human care is available. fileciteturn3file0

---

## 3) What Lilo actually does (business terms)
- **Emotion → Action:** Real‑time affect + **micro‑interventions** (timers, journaling, call prompts, reminders). fileciteturn3file1
- **Safety‑first:** Scripted crisis language, conservative defaults, **human handoff**, complete audit trail. fileciteturn3file2
- **Reporting:** Minutes/week, emotion trends, nudge adherence, escalations & SLAs; family/caregiver notifications (opt‑in). fileciteturn3file0

---

## 4) Pilot design for Healthcare (90–120 days)
**Design:** 100–300 members, text‑first (voice optional), inclusion/exclusion defined with Healthcare; written escalation protocol & BAA.  
**Success gates:**  
- Engagement **≥25 min/week**; **20–30% arousal reduction** in high‑stress interactions (turn‑level); **UCLA‑3 improvement** vs baseline; **zero unhandled crises**; reporting SLAs met. fileciteturn3file2  
**Cadence:** weekly safety council; bi‑weekly exec readouts; mid‑pilot tuning; final ROI scenarios. fileciteturn3file0

---

## 5) Outcomes & business case (illustrative)
- **Leading indicators** (weeks 1–8): engagement, emotion regulation deltas, reflection/nudge adherence, on‑time escalations. fileciteturn3file0  
- **Directional lagging signals** (weeks 8–12): avoidable ED/IP trends in engaged cohort (actuarial review with Healthcare). fileciteturn3file1  

**ROI sketch (co‑built with Healthcare actuaries):**
- *Avoided events* = Baseline rate × engaged lives × effect size (scenario A/B/C).  
- *Care‑manager time saved* = (# members triaged by Lilo × avg minutes avoided).  
- *Net* = avoided costs + labor savings + quality proxies − program fees. fileciteturn3file0

---

## 6) Packaging & pricing (guidance)
- **Health plans:** PMPM software tiers with optional voice minutes; enterprise add‑ons (SSO, analytics export, caregiver portal). Benchmarks: **$3–$8 PMPM** for targeted cohorts (final pricing by feature/integration scope). fileciteturn3file1

---

## 7) Proof points & differentiators (what Healthcare will ask)
- **Software‑first, device‑agnostic** deployment on day one. fileciteturn3file1  
- **Emotion‑aware policy graph** with healthcare‑grade safety and auditability. fileciteturn3file1  
- **Pilot‑to‑scale motion** with predefined success criteria and executive readouts. fileciteturn3file0  
- **HIPAA posture** (BAA, DSAR/erasure, minimization). fileciteturn3file2

## 8) Likely VP questions — and crisp answers
### Strategy & outcomes
- **How does this move Stars/CAHPS?** Warm, proactive check‑ins + timely handoffs improve member‑perceived support; we report leading indicators linked to experience and adherence (engagement, mood deltas, nudges). fileciteturn3file2  
- **Proof of impact?** Pilot success gates: ≥25 min/week, 20–30% arousal reduction, UCLA‑3 improvement; then directional ED/IP analysis on engaged cohort. fileciteturn3file2

### Financials & ROI
- **Business case at scale?** We model scenarios with Healthcare baselines; savings from earlier outreach, better adherence, and calmer routines; cost drivers are tokens (LLM), storage, and optional voice minutes. fileciteturn3file1  
- **Pricing levers?** PMPM tiers; voice minutes; enterprise add‑ons (SSO, data export). fileciteturn3file0

### Operations & change management
- **Impact on care‑manager workflows?** Rising‑risk surfaced with templated context; fewer cold calls, more targeted outreach; no replacement of clinicians. fileciteturn3file0  
- **Adoption risk with seniors?** Software‑first, simple copy, optional voice; coach copy and rituals to drive habit formation. fileciteturn3file2

### Compliance & risk
- **Is it safe?** Deterministic crisis language, conservative defaults, human handoff; full audit trail and weekly safety council. fileciteturn3file0  
- **Privacy posture?** HIPAA‑ready hosting, consented emotional memory with TTL, right‑to‑erasure; PHI minimization. fileciteturn3file2

### Technology & integration (at a glance)
- **What’s required to start?** SSO, allow‑listed domains; optional CRM/inbox integration; EHR reads are not mandatory for pilot. fileciteturn3file2  
- **Vendor resilience / lock‑in?** Vendor‑portable LLM routing; software‑only footprint reduces ops risk. fileciteturn3file1

---

## 9) Competitive posture (Healthcare context)
- **Robots & avatar services:** High‑touch but services‑heavy/hardware‑heavy; Lilo positions as **lightweight, auditable software** with enterprise reporting. fileciteturn3file0  
- **Utilities & generic chat:** Useful, but not **emotion‑aware** or **healthcare‑auditable**. fileciteturn3file2

---

## 10) Implementation timeline (pilot)
**Week 0–2:** Governance, disclosures, escalation scripts; SSO + branding; staff orientation.  
**Week 3–4:** Cohort onboarding; baseline surveys; go‑live; dashboards.  
**Week 5–8:** Tuning; interim readouts.  
**Week 9–12:** Final outcomes + ROI scenarios; scale decision. fileciteturn3file0

1) *“Why now”* + elevator story (60s). fileciteturn3file0  
2) Live empathic dialog → **action** (breathing timer) → **safety policy** peek (3–4 min). fileciteturn3file2  
3) Dashboards: engagement, mood deltas, escalations, and SLA compliance (2–3 min). fileciteturn3file0  
4) Pilot plan + success gates + ROI sketch (3–4 min). fileciteturn3file0
