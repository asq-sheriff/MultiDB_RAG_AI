# Lilo Sales Playbook — Senior Living & Health Plans (US, 2025)

*Audience:* New Sales Executives (Enterprise & Public Sector)  
*Use:* Read-through onboarding + field-ready talk tracks, ROI calculator inputs, objection handling, and pilot playbook  
*Geography:* United States  
*Product:* **Lilo — Senior Companion** (software-first, emotion-aware, HIPAA-ready)

---

## 1) The Elevator Story (30/60/120 seconds)
**30s — Senior Living:**
> *“Lilo gives your staff superpowers. It provides friendly, emotion-aware check-ins and guided routines between human visits—helping residents stay calmer, connected, and on-schedule—while escalating to your team when something looks risky.”*

**30s — Health Plans:**
> *“Lilo is a coverage multiplier for care management. It turns minutes of conversation into measurable calm, routine, and connection—and flags at-risk members sooner, with auditable, privacy-first engagement data that supports Stars and CAHPS.”*

**60s (both):**
- Emotion-aware companion (text/voice) that pairs empathic dialog **with actions** (timers, breathing, journaling, call-a-friend, reminders).  
- **Safety-first** policy graph + crisis playbooks (audited, conservative defaults).  
- **HIPAA-ready** backend with consented personal memory and right-to-erasure.  
- Software-first rollout on existing devices; pilot-ready in weeks.

**120s (both):**
- The “why now”: rising demand, persistent staffing shortages, and payer focus on experience and SDoH.  
- Measurable leading indicators (engagement minutes, mood/loneliness deltas, nudge adherence) translate into operational lifts (fewer anxiety escalations, better routines) and directional utilization benefit for payers.

## 2) Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)
### Senior Living & Home Care Operators
- **Who:** Assisted living, independent living, memory care, home care franchises.  
- **Pain:** Staffing constraints, resident anxiety/behavioral episodes, family communication gaps, need for differentiated engagement.  
- **Impact:** Stabilize routines and mood; create documented touchpoints between visits; family CSAT; safer, auditable escalation.

### Health Plans (MA, SNP, ACOs)
- **Who:** Medicare Advantage plans and ACOs; BH programs with long waitlists.  
- **Pain:** Experience scores (CAHPS), loneliness/SDoH risk, late identification of distress, thin care manager bandwidth.  
- **Impact:** Earlier outreach to rising risk; nudge adherence to meds/visits; experience lifts; evidence trail for quality programs.

---

## 3) What We Actually Deliver
- **Emotion Engine:** Continuous valence×arousal + discrete labels; regulates tone and chooses micro‑interventions.
- **Action Toolkit:** Breathing and mindfulness timers, journaling prompts, call/family prompts, resource lookups, reminders.
- **Safety & Compliance:** Crisis playbooks; human handoff; DSAR/erasure; PHI minimization; BAA-backed hosting.
- **Reporting:** Engagement minutes, mood/loneliness deltas, adherence, risk events/SLAs, caregiver notifications.
- **Integrations:** SSO, care‑manager inbox or CRM, optional EHR reads, SMS/voice gateways.

## 4) Discovery Guide (qualify hard)
**Senior Living**  
1) What’s your **resident-to-staff** ratio and where are pain points (evenings, weekends)?  
2) What **behavioral triggers** (anxiety, sundowning) generate most escalations?  
3) How do you **communicate with families** today? What’s the top complaint?  
4) Which metrics matter most—**falls, ED transfers, incident reports, family CSAT**, occupancy/length of stay?  
5) What devices are available in-room (tablets, smart speakers)?  

**Health Plans**  
1) Which **Star/CAHPS** measures or **HOS** lifts are priorities this year?  
2) How do you identify **loneliness/SDoH** (screeners, Z‑codes, analytics)?  
3) Where does care management **bottleneck**—outreach, triage, adherence?  
4) What is your threshold for **evidence** in a pilot (leading indicators vs. matched-control utilization)?  
5) Data contracts/BAA: single-cloud preference or flexible?

## 5) Value Narratives (Talk Tracks)
### Senior Living
- **Staff multiplier:** Lilo handles friendly check-ins and routines between rounds; staff focus on human tasks.  
- **Resident steadiness:** Short guided actions reduce arousal and structure the day (sleep, meals, activities).  
- **Family trust:** Opt‑in summaries and notifications improve transparency and satisfaction.  
- **Safety posture:** Scripted crisis language, documented escalation, auditable logs.

**Proof points to aim for in pilots:**
- Engagement ≥25 min/week/resident;  
- ↓ incident reports related to anxiety/behavior;  
- ↑ participation in activities;  
- ↑ family CSAT/NPS.

### Health Plans
- **Rising‑risk surfacing:** Conversation + pattern checks flag members earlier for human outreach.  
- **Adherence nudges:** Gentle reminders for meds/visits; journaling for symptom trends.  
- **Experience & SDoH:** Warm interactions and timely check‑ins tied to CAHPS experience; documented SDoH context via consented notes.  
- **Auditability:** Every escalation and suggestion is traceable.

**Proof points to aim for in pilots:**
- Engagement ≥25 min/week/member;  
- ↓ reported loneliness (UCLA‑3);  
- ↑ nudge adherence for meds/visits;  
- Directional ↓ in avoidable ED/IP among engaged cohort.

## 6) Outcomes & ROI Model (Template)
**Inputs:** target population, adoption %, engagement minutes, baseline ED/IP/SNF rates, unit costs, care‑manager time value.  
**Mechanisms:** (a) earlier triage → timely human outreach; (b) adherence nudges; (c) calmer routines reducing last‑minute escalations; (d) family activation.  
**Outputs:** avoided events (scenarios), care‑manager time saved, experience score lift proxies.

**Formula sketch:**  
- *Avoided events* = Baseline rate × engaged lives × effect size (scenario A/B/C).  
- *Care‑manager time saved* = (# at‑risk members triaged by Lilo × avg minutes avoided).  
- *Net* = avoided costs + labor savings + quality proxies − program fees.

*We maintain a spreadsheet; sales can plug plan/ operator baselines to produce scenarios live.*

## 7) Competitive Field Notes (Do/Don’t Say)
**ElliQ (robot):** Embodied, proactive; strong engagement. *Don’t* disparage hardware; *do* position Lilo’s software‑first TCO, integrations, and policy transparency.  
**CareCoach (tablet avatar + human back‑office):** High‑touch; proven in home/PACE. *Do* acknowledge service strength; *position* Lilo as lighter‑weight, scalable, with auditable automation.  
**Alexa Together:** Great utility (alerts, remote assist) at low price point; *position* Lilo as emotion‑aware companion with health‑program reporting and HIPAA posture.  
**Generic chat apps:** Not senior‑specific nor enterprise‑ready; *position* Lilo’s safety governance, auditing, and clinical advisors.

---

## 8) Objection Handling (Evidence‑Led)
- **“Will this replace staff or caregivers?”** No—Lilo augments and escalates; residents often connect **more** with people via prompts (call‑a‑friend/family).  
- **“Is it safe for edge cases?”** Crisis playbooks + human handoff; conservative defaults; logged rationales.  
- **“What about privacy?”** HIPAA‑ready; consented memory with TTL and one‑click erasure.  
- **“Show me proof.”** We present leading indicators first (engagement, mood/loneliness delta, adherence), then build utilization analyses with partner data.

## 9) Pilot Playbook (90–120 days)
**Design:** 100–300 participants (one or two personas), text‑first with optional voice, clear inclusion/exclusion, written escalation protocol.
