# Lilo — Senior Companion
**Customer Value Brief (United States, 2025)**

> **Plain‑English promise:** Lilo gives your residents/members a friendly, emotion‑aware companion that helps them feel calmer, stay on routine, and connect with people—while giving your team earlier visibility and auditable safety.

---

## 1) At a glance
- **What it is:** A software‑first companion (chat + optional voice) that blends empathic conversation with **actionable micro‑interventions** (breathing timers, journaling, call‑a‑friend prompts, reminders) and **safety playbooks** for escalation.  
- **Who it’s for:**  
  - **Senior living & home‑care** operators who want steadier days, fewer avoidable incidents, and happier families—without adding headcount.  
  - **Health plans (Medicare Advantage/ACOs)** that want earlier triage, better adherence, and member‑experience lifts—without overloading care managers.  
- **Why now:** Demand for support is rising, staffing is tight, and experience/quality measures matter more than ever.

---

## 2) The problem (business terms)
- Residents and members often feel anxious or disconnected **between** human touchpoints.  
- Staff and care managers can’t be everywhere; late detection creates last‑minute escalations.  
- Traditional “utilities” (alerts, general chatbots) don’t address **emotions** or provide **auditable** escalation and outcomes.

---

## 3) What makes Lilo different
- **Emotion → Action:** Lilo doesn’t just sound kind; it models a user’s emotional state and chooses **practical next steps** (e.g., a 2‑minute breathing timer, a nudge to call family, or a plan for the evening).  
- **Safety‑first by design:** Conservative defaults, scripted crisis language, human handoff, and full audit trail—so your team can trust and verify.  
- **Software‑only footprint:** Runs on the devices you already have (tablet, phone, browser).  
- **Privacy‑first:** Consented emotional memory with time limits; HIPAA‑ready hosting; right‑to‑erasure; minimal data retention.

---

## 4) How it works (simple flow)
1) **Listen** — Lilo chats (and optionally listens to voice) in plain language.  
2) **Understand** — It estimates the user’s emotional state (e.g., anxious, calm) and confidence.  
3) **Act** — It offers short, proven actions (timers, journaling prompts, call‑a‑friend, resource lookups, reminders).  
4) **Escalate** — If risk is detected, it switches to scripted language and routes to humans based on your protocol.  
5) **Report** — You get engagement and safety dashboards (minutes of conversation, emotion trends, adherence to nudges, escalations handled on time).

---

## 5) Business value — Senior Living & Home‑Care
**Operational relief**  
- Fewer anxiety‑related incidents; steadier routines at night and weekends.  
- Documented touchpoints **between rounds** without adding staff.

**Family satisfaction**  
- Opt‑in summaries give families confidence and clarity.  
- Residents are gently prompted to connect with friends/family.

**Risk management**  
- Scripted crisis language, clear escalation, and audit logs.  
- Transparency for incident reviews and state/regional reporting.

**What we measure**  
- Engagement minutes/week, reductions in anxiety‑related incidents, activity participation, family CSAT/NPS, on‑time escalations.

---

## 6) Business value — Health Plans (MA/ACOs)
**Earlier triage, right door**  
- Natural conversations surface concerns sooner; warm handoffs to care management.  

**Adherence support**  
- Gentle reminders for meds/appointments; journaling to spot patterns that matter.  

**Experience & SDoH**  
- Friendly, proactive check‑ins that support CAHPS/HOS experience; optional capture of context (with consent) for SDoH programs.  

**What we measure**  
- Engagement minutes/week, loneliness/mood deltas, adherence to nudges, rising‑risk surfaced → human outreach, directional impact on avoidable ED/IP (partner analysis).

---

## 7) Where Lilo fits vs. alternatives
- **Robots (e.g., embodied companions):** High presence but higher cost/ops. Lilo delivers **software‑level** presence and action on existing devices.  
- **Utilities (alerts, generic assistants):** Useful but not emotion‑aware or auditable. Lilo adds **emotional intelligence** and **safety controls**.  
- **Human‑only programs:** Always essential—Lilo acts as a **coverage multiplier** between human touchpoints.

---

## 8) Outcomes & success criteria (pilot template)
- **Engagement:** ≥ **25 minutes** of conversation per user per week.  
- **Emotional regulation:** **20–30% reduction** in arousal during high‑stress moments (within ~3 conversational turns).  
- **Connection & adherence:** ≥ **2 meaningful check‑ins**/week; improvement in meds/visit adherence.  
- **Safety:** **Zero unhandled crises**; all escalations handled within your SLA.  
- **Experience:** Family CSAT/NPS (operators) or member experience proxies (plans).

*We co‑define targets with you, then report them weekly and in a month‑end summary.*

## 9) Case vignettes (illustrative)
**Evening anxiety (Senior Living):**  
Rose often feels anxious after dinner. Lilo checks in, mirrors her mood, suggests a 2‑minute breathing timer, then cues a familiar playlist. Anxiety eases; Rose joins the evening activity. Staff see the interaction and note no escalation was needed.

**Post‑discharge nerves (Health Plan):**  
Tom left the hospital after a minor procedure. Lilo prompts a check‑in, confirms meds plan, and logs a light pain journal for 3 days. When Tom reports confusion, Lilo routes a warm handoff to care management with the right context.
